### If you're planning to apply to a large number of companies you're probably familiar with that feeling we get after submitting an application:
*"Where should I apply next?"*
<br>
*"Am I ready to apply to my dream job?"*
<br>
*"Should I apply today or wait for Monday? Or maybe after the holidays..."*
<br>

### You might be surprised at how much energy is spent just deciding where to apply next. Let's **reduce the cognitive load** and use that energy to hone our skills and perform well in interviews.
